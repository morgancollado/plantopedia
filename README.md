# Plantopedia

Welcome to Plantopedia! This gem allows you to search the Trefle API for plant data to help you better take care of your plants. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'plantopedia'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install plantopedia

## Usage

This is a command line app that only runs from the terminal. You search the database by common name or scientific name and the app populates a list of matching plants. You then select the one you want to learn more about by inputing the numnber associated with the plant. You can repeat this search as many times as you like.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
